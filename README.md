# Introduction to PyTorch

## Hey There!

This repo contains some of the code I created while getting started with the popular Machine Learning Library, PyTorch. PyTorch is an open source library, used for common tasks such as building computer vision models and Natural Language Processing networks. In this notebook, I've tried to build some intuition on the features of PyTorch and demonstrate the ease with which we can deploy and train networks, by using PyTorch to do the heavy lifting for us.

Notebook Outline:
- Setting up GPU, and writing simple functions to observe how easily PyTorch can backpropagate and calculate gradients.
- Creating simple toy data and training a network with PyTorch features.
- Generating blob data and writing structured functions for training, using PyTorch loss calculation.
- Writing a primitive class for our network, using PyTorch initializations and separate function for the training loop.
- Writing more complex classes to simplify our initialization, defining training functions that use PyTorch optimizers.
